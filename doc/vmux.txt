COMMANDS                                        *vmux-commands*

These commands are only effective if you were inside a tmux session. Otherwise,
Vmux will stop you from execution as it is nonsense.

                                                *vmux-:VmuxDispatch*
:VmuxDispatch {payload}   Dispatch the payload to the companion pane.  Vmux
													will first load the payload into a tmux buffer.
                          Afterwards, the tmux buffer will be pasted into the
                          companion pane. At last, carriage return will be
                          sent to the companion pane to execute the payload.
