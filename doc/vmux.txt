COMMANDS                                        *vmux-commands*

These commands are only effective if you were inside a tmux session. Otherwise,
Vmux will stop you from execution as it is nonsense.

                                               *vmux-:VmuxDispatch*
:VmuxDispatch {payload}   Dispatch the payload to the companion pane.

                          Vmux will first ensure that a companion pane exist
                          and visible. Otherwise, Vmux will spawn a companion
                          pane and/or exit any zoomed state.

                          Afterwards, Vmux will load the payload into a tmux
                          buffer and paste it into the companion pane.

                          Lastly, if the last character of the payload is not a
                          newline character, Vmux will send a carriage return
                          key to the companion pane executing the payload.

                                               *vmux-:VmuxDispatchLast*
:VmuxDispatchLast         Dispatch the last command to the companion pane.

                          Vmux will remember your last dispatched payload in
                          order to send the last command for you.

                          Moreover, you can use `.` command to repeat the last
                          dispatch command if you have repeat.vim installed.
