INTRODUCTION                                    *vmux*

REPL anything! Dispatch commands to tmux companion pane with just two clicks.

QUICK START																		  *vmux-quick-start*

Add the following mappings to your .vimrc.
>
>
  " Dispatch selection to companion pane (e.g. vipg,)
  xmap g,    <Plug>(Vmux_dispatch)

  " Start Vmux for a motion / text object (e.g. g,ip)
  nmap g,    <Plug>(Vmux_dispatch)

  " Dispatch current line to companion pane
  imap <M-,> <Plug>(Vmux_dispatch)

<

COMMANDS                                        *vmux-commands*

These commands are only effective if you were inside a tmux session. Otherwise,
Vmux will stop you from execution as it is nonsense.

                                                *vmux-:VmuxDispatch*
:VmuxDispatch {payload}   Dispatch the payload to the companion pane.  Vmux
													will first load the payload into a tmux buffer.
                          Afterwards, the tmux buffer will be pasted into the
                          companion pane. At last, carriage return will be
                          sent to the companion pane to execute the payload.
