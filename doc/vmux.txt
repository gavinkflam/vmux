Add the following mappings to your .vimrc.
>
>
  " Dispatch selection to companion pane (e.g. vipg,)
  xmap g,    <Plug>(Vmux_dispatch)

  " Start Vmux for a motion / text object (e.g. g,ip)
  nmap g,    <Plug>(Vmux_dispatch)

  " Dispatch current line to companion pane

COMMANDS                                        *vmux-commands*

These commands are only effective if you were inside a tmux session. Otherwise,
Vmux will stop you from execution as it is nonsense.

                                                *:VmuxDispatch*
:VmuxDispatch {payload}   Dispatch the payload to the companion pane.

                          Vmux will first ensure that a companion pane exist
                          and visible. Otherwise, Vmux will spawn a companion
                          pane and/or exit any zoomed state.

                          Afterwards, Vmux will load the payload into a tmux
                          buffer and paste it into the companion pane.

                          Lastly, if the last character of the payload is not a
                          newline character, Vmux will send a carriage return
                          key to the companion pane executing the payload.

                                                *:VmuxDispatchLast*
:VmuxDispatchLast         Dispatch the last command to the companion pane.

                          Vmux will remember your last dispatched payload in
                          order to send the last command for you.

                          Moreover, you can use `.` command to repeat the last
                          dispatch command if you have repeat.vim installed.

                                                *:VmuxKillPane*
:VmuxKillPane             Kill the companion pane via tmux `kill-pane` command.

                                                *:VmuxClearPane*
:VmuxClearPane            Clear outputs of the companion pane via sending `C-l`
                          key sequence.

OPTIONS                                         *vmux-options*

To change an option item, add a |let| statement to your |.vimrc|. Example: >
  let g:vmux#companion_pane_arguments = '-h -d -p 30 -c "#{pane_current_path}"'
<

g:vmux#companion_pane_arguments = '-h -d -p 30 -c "#{pane_current_path}"'

  Change the default arguments for launching the tmux companion pane.

  The default arguments aim at utilizing wide screens and prevent interuption
  of the flow.
