# Vmux

REPL anything! Dispatch commands to tmux companion pane without changing focus.

## Install

Use your favourite plugin manager to install Vmux.

If you don't have an idea, I recommend [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

- [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
  - `Plug 'gavinkflam/vmux'`
- [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
  - `git clone https://github.com/gavinkflam/vmux ~/.vim/bundle/vmux`

## Quick Start

Add the following mappings to your .vimrc.

```vim
" Dispatch selection to companion pane (e.g. vipg,)
xmap g,    <Plug>(Vmux_dispatch)

" Start Vmux for a motion / text object (e.g. g,ip)
nmap g,    <Plug>(Vmux_dispatch_op)

" Dispatch current line to companion pane
imap <M-,> <Plug>(Vmux_dispatch)
nmap g,,   <Plug>(Vmux_dispatch)
```

## Other Useful Commands

`:VmuxClearPane` clear outputs of the companion pane by sending ctrl-L key
sequence.

`:VmuxKillPane` kills the companion pane via tmux `kill-pane` command.

`:VmuxDispatchLast` dispatch the last command to the companion pane.

## repeat.vim support

`g,`, `g,,` and `Alt-,` works with
[repeat.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat) if you have it installed.

## Roadmap

- Add screencasts
- Add Vader test scripts
- Add Travis CI scripts

## FAQ

### How to customize the companion pane?

You can change the default arguments for launching the tmux companion pane.

The default arguments aim at utilizing width of screen spaces and prevent
interuption of the flow.

It will split a vertical pane of 30% the screen width without changing focus.
Moreover, starting with the current path of the pane running vim.

You can refer to the example below.

```vim
let g:vmux#companion_pane_arguments = '-h -d -p 30 -c "#{pane_current_path}"'
```
